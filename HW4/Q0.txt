Do you think a decision tree will work for the politician dataset?
A decision tree will work well for the politician dataset. The are a fixed set of attributes, past votes held, each with a binary response, for or against the vote. There is also a small number of outputs. In fact this is binary as well, democrat or republican. There are some cases where a politician may not have voted on a bill, and decision trees do a great job handling missing attribute values. Also in general, in the US, politicians aligned with a certain party all tend to vote the same way on proposed bills which means there should be a reasonably distinct pattern that the decision tree can pick up on quickly, i.e. low depth.

Do You thing a decision tree will work for the education dataset?
A decision tree will work for the education dataset as given as it has been reduced to a small number of attributes with a binary decision and a binary output value. All the reasons mentioned above hold for this dataset as well. Because the problem has been reduced down to "A" or "not A" there should be a strong correlation between number of A's and the final output. It's likely that this problem will also reveal the weights of the assignments. In the real world, meaning number grades for each attribute and a number grade for the output, a decision tree would be less optimal. Decision trees likely exist that can handle this but there are also likely much more efficient methods than mapping several 0-100 grades to a 0-100 grade.
