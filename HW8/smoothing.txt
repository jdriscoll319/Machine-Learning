As the smoothing value increases the accuracy of the classifier decreases.
q=0.1 made the classifier better. q=0.01 was even better.
q=0.5 and q=1.0 produced the same result.
q=5.0 decreased the accuracy of the classifier.
q=0 resulted in a failure in my code. There are likely cases where liberal words do not appear in conservative blogs and vice versa. 
This will result in log(0) and is the reason we have been smoothing in the first place.
