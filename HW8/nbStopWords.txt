There is no improvement in the classification on split.test until you remove the 24 most common words from split.train.
The algorithm stops making improvements after the 36 most common words are removed from split.train.
The algorithm also starts to take much longer as you increase the number of words to remove. There is probably a more efficient way to code this than my approach.
